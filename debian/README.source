Bootstrapping the documentation
-------------------------------

To build the documentation you need to first bootstrap the packages. This is
easily done by first building only arch: any packages of qtbase, qtxmlpatterns,
qtdeclarative, qtscript, qtwebkit and qttools.

Using the resulting qttools5-dev-tools package, you will be able to build
arch:all packages for all Qt modules.
